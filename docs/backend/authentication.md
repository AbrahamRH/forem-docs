# Authentication

:::important

Weâ€™re currently making rapid changes to the product so our docs may be out of date. If you need help, please email [yo@forem.com](mailto:yo@forem.com).

:::

Authentication is handled by [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
and [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth).

On Forem you can authenticate through Facebook, GitHub, Twitter or Apple. Please check out
the respective guides on how to authenticate:

- [Forem authentication](auth-forem)
- [Apple authentication](auth-apple)
- [Facebook authentication](auth-facebook)
- [Github authentication](auth-github)
- [Google authentication](auth-google)
- [Twitter authentication](auth-twitter)

We may add other authentication providers in the future. Please check back
again, or search
