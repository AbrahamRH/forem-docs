# Forem Authentication

Forem allows you to authenticate using the [Forem Passport](https://passport.forem.com) service. Enabling this authentication provider is highly encouraged in order to benefit from the many Forem Ecosystem integrations (i.e. mobile apps).

Better integration with the `/admin` dashboard is currently under development but in the mean time you will be able to enable the Forem Authentication provider with the following steps:

1. Create an account in https://passport.forem.com
2. Send an email to [hello@forem.com](mailto:hello+passport@forem.com) requesting access to the Creator Tools
3. Request the `Key` and `Secret` credentials for your Forem instance in the Creator tools
4. Enable the Forem Authentication provider with these values
