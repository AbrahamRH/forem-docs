# Forem Authentication

Forem allows you to authenticate using the [Forem Passport](https://passport.forem.com) service. Enabling this authentication provider is highly encouraged in order to benefit from the many Forem Ecosystem integrations (i.e. mobile apps).

Better integration with the `/admin` dashboard is currently under development but in the mean time you will be able to enable the Forem Authentication provider with the following steps:

1. Create an account in https://passport.forem.com
3. Use the [Forem Creator Setup](https://passport.forem.com/oauth/applications) to create new credentials for your Forem site
   - You will receive the `Key` and `Secret` credentials for your site
   - The instance logo will take a few moments to sync
4. Enable the Forem Authentication provider in your Forem admin dashboard
