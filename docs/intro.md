# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

:::important

Weâ€™re currently making rapid changes to the product so our docs may be out of date. If you need help, please email [yo@forem.com](mailto:yo@forem.com).

## Welcome to Forem's developer documentation ðŸŒ±

On this site you'll find instructions to setup a [local instance of
Forem](./getting-started/installation/mac), documentation on the [architecture of
Forem](./technical-overview/architecture/), [how to contribute](./contributing-guide/docs), and many other useful
documents.

This documentation site is the product of a number of volunteer contributors
working alongside the Forem Core Team, special thanks to all those who have
contributed to the documentation.

:::important

To set up and self-host your own Forem we suggest using our [Forem Self-host Installation Documentation](https://github.com/forem/selfhost)
