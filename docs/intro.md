# Introduction ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome to Forem's developer documentation ðŸŒ±

On this site you'll find instructions to setup a [local instance of
Forem](./getting-started/installation/mac), documentation on the [architecture of
Forem](./technical-overview/architecture/), [how to contribute](./contributing-guide/docs), and many other useful
documents.

This documentation site is the product of a number of volunteer contributors
working alongside the Forem Core Team, special thanks to all those who have
contributed to the documentation.

This guide does not offer development guidance for self-hosting a Forem or managing a Forem community of your own. For those who have yet to install the app that are hoping to self-host, please check out our [Forem Selfhost Installation Documentation](https://github.com/forem/selfhost-devel). If you would like to learn more about Forem Administration, please read our [Forem Admin Docs](https://admin.forem.com/).
