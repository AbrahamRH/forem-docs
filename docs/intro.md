# Welcome to Forem's developer documentation ðŸŒ±

On this site you'll find instructions to setup a [local instance of
Forem](./installation/mac), documentation on the [architecture of
Forem](./technical-overview/architecture/), [how to contribute](./contributing-guide/docs), and many other useful
documents.

This documentation site is the product of a number of volunteer contributors
working alongside the Forem Core Team, special thanks to all those who have
contributed to the documentation.
