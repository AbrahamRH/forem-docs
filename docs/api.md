# API

:::important

Weâ€™re currently making rapid changes to the product so our docs may be out of date. If you need help, please email [yo@forem.com](mailto:yo@forem.com).

:::

There are two versions of the API: [version 0](/api/v0) and [version 1](/api/v1).

## [Version 0](/api/v0)

This is the legacy API. It is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Clients can continue to use
it as is, but we recommend using the version 1 API.

## [Version 1](/api/v1)

This is the current version of the API. It is the recommended way to interact with Forem. Version 1 requires clients
to use both an `accept` header and a `api-key` header. 

The `accept` header must be set to `application/vnd.forem.api-v1+json`.
The `api-key` header must be set to the API key for the user. This API key can be generated by the user via their
settings page in Forem.
