The Forem frontend codebase uses the [Islands Architecture pattern](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture): a server-side rendered app that has pockets of interactivity. Think of it as multi mini-applications existing in the frontend.

You can see this in the app with the way we handle Preact components - loading them in to replace or enhance parts of a server-rendered view (some good examples include our `Modal` and `Snackbar` components).

- Served via webpack(er)
- Mostly used for individual components rich with interactivity
- In some cases Preact "takes over" from a server-rendered, plainer, version of the same (e.g. articleForm.jsx and app/views/articles/_v2_form.html.erb) - try clicking 'Create Post' with JS disabled ðŸ˜‰

** A note on dynamic imports **

Unlike the backend, it's costly downloading frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JS), which is why we should only ever download what we need to render a page in a usable state. From there we can load enhanced interactivity, like the page feed, or modals. The general pattern is only load something when you need it.

This is why youâ€™ll find [dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#dynamic_imports) in our code.

Here are some sections of code worth checking out:

- [Onboarding](https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/0024fe40d6ade998a216216b00f157fa7f49e1c0/app/javascript/packs/Onboarding.jsx#L20-L26)
- [Pausing animated gifs on a post](https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/0024fe40d6ade998a216216b00f157fa7f49e1c0/app/javascript/packs/articlePage.jsx#L11-L17)
- [Loading Modals in the member details view](https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/0024fe40d6ade998a216216b00f157fa7f49e1c0/app/javascript/packs/admin/editUser.jsx#L84-L89) in the admin section. The Modal code isn't loaded until someone requests the first modal. From there it's dynamically loaded and then required imports continue to be accessible/cached for the next time we need it.
